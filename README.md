QUESTION 1
Create a program for managing a library system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
concepts in Java. The program should allow users to add, delete, and search for books in the
library, as well as track borrowing and returning of books by library members.
The program should have the following classes:
1. Book class with attributes such as book ID, title, author, publisher, and
year of publication.
2. Member class with attributes such as member ID, name, contact information,
and borrowing history.
3. Library class with methods for adding and removing books, searching for books by
title or author, and tracking borrowing and returning of books by
members.
The program should also have a user interface that allows users to interact with the library
system and perform the above tasks.
Your task is to implement the above requirements using OOP concepts in Java, demonstrating
proper encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism principles. Additionally, you should
implement error handling for invalid user input and ensure that the program is efficient and
scalable for a large library system.

Question 2
Create a program for booking system that can handle different types of bookings, such as
hotel reservations, flight bookings, and car rentals. Your program could design classes such
as Booking, Customer, and Location, and use inheritance and polymorphism to create
subclasses for different types of bookings and locations. Use encapsulation to protect
sensitive data such as booking details and customer information, and use interfaces to allow
different parts of the system to communicate with each other.
For example, you could define an interface called "Bookable" that includes methods for
reserving a location, cancelling a reservation, and retrieving booking details. Then, you could
have different classes that implement this interface, such as a HotelBooking class that
handles hotel reservations, a FlightBooking class that handles flight bookings, and a
CarRentalBooking class that handles car rental reservations.
You could also design a Customer class that stores information about each customer, such
as their name, address, and payment information, and use inheritance to create
subclasses for different types of customers, such as individual customers and corporate
customers. This could allow you to offer different pricing and discounts based on customer
needs or other factors.
By using object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism,
encapsulation, and interfaces, you could create a flexible and robust booking system that can
handle different types of bookings and locations, and can adapt to changing business needs
over time.

Question 3
Create a flexible ordering system that can handle different types of orders, such as food
orders, merchandise orders, and service orders. You could design classes such as Order,
Customer, and Item, and use inheritance and polymorphism to create subclasses for
different types of orders and items. You could also use encapsulation to protect sensitive data
such as order details and customer information and use interfaces to allow different parts of
the system to communicate with each other.
For example, you could define an interface called "Orderable" that includes methods for
adding and removing items from an order, calculating the total price, and placing the order.
Then, you could have different classes that implement this interface, such as a FoodOrder
class that handles food orders, a MerchandiseOrder class that handles merchandise
orders, and a ServiceOrder class that handles service orders.
You could also design a Customer class that stores information about each customer, such
as their name, address, and payment information, and use inheritance to create
subclasses for different types of customers, such as regular customers and VIP
customers. This could allow you to offer different pricing and discounts based on customer
loyalty or other factors.
By using object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism,
encapsulation, and interfaces, you could create a flexible and scalable ordering system that
can handle different types of orders and items, and can adapt to changing business needs
over time.
